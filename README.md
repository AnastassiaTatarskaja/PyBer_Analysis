# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the project

Using Python and knowledge of Pandas, a summary of the DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type was created. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type was added.

## Results

As we can see from the Ride Total Screenshot below, the highest amount of rides are in the urban city type, 1625. Second highest is in the suburban type, 625. The lowest number of total rides are in the rural type, 125. Consequently, the highest number of total drivers are in the urban city type, 2405. Second highest number of the total drivers  are in the suburban type, 490. The lowest number of the total drivers are in the rural type, 78. As a result, total fares collected are highest in the urban city type, around $40,000, and lowest is in the rural type, around $4,000. 

When examining the average fare per ride, the highest fare per ride is in the rural type, $34.62 and the lowest is in the urban city type. Consequently, the highest average fare per driver is in rural city type, $55.49, and the lowest is in the urban type, $16.57, with suburban city type being in the middle range of $39.50.

When examining Total Fares by City Type weekly, as shown in the graph below, we can see that the rides in all city types increase in the third week of February and then decrease again in the first week of March. However, the rides in the urban type show steady increase and decline throughout the month of March, unlike rural and suburban types where the rides remain flat. We can also see that the rides in the rural and urban types increase in the beginning of April, whereas the number of rides in the suburban types decrease.

## Summary

### Recommendations to the CEO to increase profitability:

1. Since average fare per driver in the Rural and Suburban types are higher than average fare per ride, the company could reduce the number of drivers while keeping the number of rides the same. For example, instead of having 78 drivers, there could be only 50 drivers available. Less drivers will reduce the average fare per driver. 
2. Since the demand for rides increases in the third week of February, the company could increase the number of drivers during that period in anticipation of higher ride requests. 
3. The company should take a deeper dive into a five year trend data to identify weeks in the year with the highest number of rides and the lowest number of rides and schedule the number of drivers accordingly. There should be more drivers during the high demand times, and lower number of drivers during the low demand to offset the costs. Five year data will provide a better overall picture year to year. It will help to keep the costs down and increase profitability for the company.
